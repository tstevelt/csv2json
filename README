A couple of warnings about -style
	1. If first row of CSV file contains column headings and program
	   is run without the -header option, then you will probably not 
	   get the expected results.  All columns will most likely be 
	   output as strings (unless you have an integer as a column heading).

	2. Column headings are required for -style dict, bloated and keyed.
